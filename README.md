*Don't Get Stabbed* is a mechanically deep Multiplayer Role Playing Game that simulates a giant prison complex filled with real people.  To give a general idea of what the game has to offer, here are some random examples of roles the player can take on*:
- a hardened criminal shot caller who vies for power against rival gangs ⬜ <!--✅-->
- a no-nonsense Correctional Officer who tries to keep his inmates in line ⬜
- a Confidential Informant who tries to balance his standing with both the gangs and the COs to fuel his drug addiction ⬜
- a Chaplain trying to save some souls among the damned ⬜
- a psychologist trying to decrease tensions in genpop with inmate group sessions ⬜
- an overworked Warden having to oversee the execution of a deadrow inmate while understaffed ⬜
- a corrupt CO smuggling in contraband for one of the gangs ⬜
- ..

And here are some random flavor examples of things you are able to do*:

- keister (hide in your ass) a shiv (prisonmade knives) ⬜
- discipline a new inmate for accidentally stepping into another car's (faction) territory ⬜
- charm a CO until he gives you a job in the mail room ⬜
- pass kites (written messages) around from cell to cell, but be careful who might intercept them! ⬜
- search the inmates for contraband when they leave the workshop ⬜
- ..

*(\* The project is still in early development. Unchecked features are not yet in the game.)*
